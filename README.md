# Workday Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple coding quiz.  It was created as an exercise to practice various javascript concepts, in particular using the DOM to add event listeners and interface with the html, using timeIntervals, and implementing local storage.

When the start button is clicked, a series of multiple choice questions will populate with buttons that the user can click to select their answer.  When the quiz is complete, the user will be able to enter their initials and pressing 'Submit' will save their score onto a high score list.  Clicking the view high scores text on the top left will allow the user to view the current highscore list at any time.  When viewing the highscore list, pressing the 'Clear Highscores' button will clear the current high scores list, and pressing the 'Go Back' button will return to the previous screen, or to the start screen if their last quiz results were just submitted.
